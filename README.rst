What Is It?
-----------

This is a simple todo list app, built for my personal use. The design goals for
it are:

* It will follow the standard GTD scheme: Context, Project, Priority, Deferred
  Tasks, etc.
* It will allow entry through a single text input that has auto-suggest and
  allows setting context, project and user-delegation through markup (e.g., @
  for context, + for project) 
* It will be highly usable on mobile devices (uses Bootstrap's responsive
  layout)
* It will allow collaboration with other users by allowing users to enable
  shared viewing of projects and delegation of todos
* It will support "deferred" actions
